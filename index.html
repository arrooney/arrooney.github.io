	<h1>Climbing</h1>
	<h3>I have been climbing since the age of 8, and ever since beginning I haven't been able to stop!</h3>
	<h3>For years I have trained for competitions on three different teams in the city, now I spend time on the weekends
		coaching young climbers.</h3>
	<h3>Competition climbing has taken me all around the province, attending numerous provincial competitions. I have also
		traveled to Vancouver and Toronto to take part in the youth national championships.</h3><br></br>
	<h3>I've also spent many wonderful weekends in the Canmore climbing on real rock, and in 2016 embarked on an adventure to
		Squamish, BC to do some boulder climbing (pictured here).</h3>
	<h3>In 2017 I packed up my rope and went climbing all around New Zealand, for which I owe much gratitude to all the
		helpful Kiwi's who let me hitch a ride with them around the countryside.</h3>
