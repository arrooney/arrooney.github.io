                            Welcome!</br></br>I'm a second year Computer Engineering Co-op at the University of Alberta. I am the AlbertaSat Software Lead, and Party Planning Co-lead! I also enjoy competitive rock climbing, and travel.<br/></br>
                            I have just finished the first Co-op work term of my degree, which was at Nokia. My position at Nokia had me learn about full stack web development including mySQL, Redis, angularJS, flask-restful and other concepts. I was able to design a webtool for internal use that required the fast loading, and processing of millions of data points!
